# SteamQueueManager
Does some automatic operations on the Steam queue

v0.1:
- click on the Not Interested button if the user tags contain some unwanted words from a predefined list.

v0.2:
- added ability to auto advance in queue after n seconds (default 6), to give the user time to check the game, with a countdown timer. this is also cancellale by clicking on the timer itself.
- gives the user the reasons why the Not Interested was selected by showing the triggering tags near the button itself.
- at the end of the queue, i show a small donation message and a link to my Trade page, send me some gifts for Christmas :)
